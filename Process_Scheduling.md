# Process_Scheduling.md
This code shows and focuses on understanding how operating systems deicde the order in which processes run. We built a Python-based simulator that implements four CPU scheduling algortihms: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Preemptive Priority. For each algorithm, the program calculates important metrics such as waiting time and turnaround time, and generates a Gantt chart to show how the CPU was shared over time. To make the study more realistic, we also integrated a Linux process snapshot using the `ps aux` command to compare our simulated results with real system behaviour. Overall, during this project we explored how different  scheduling algorithms affect performance, fairness and responsiveness in a computing environment.
